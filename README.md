## List Sorter
One of my projects as a CS1101S TA. The List Sorter applies the concepts of sorting that are discussed in CS1101S Programming Methodology lecture, namely:
- Selection Sort (implemented)
- Insertion Sort (under construction)
- Merge Sort (under construction)

The sorters are based on Source Chapter 2 List implementation, and visualises each breakpoint according the lecture concepts.

## List Visualiser
Stored in file `display-chart.js`, this file generates a proportional chart based on a given list. It works for integer values.
